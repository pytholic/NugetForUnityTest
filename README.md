# NugetForUnity
[NugetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)  is a package management system that makes it easier to install required third-party packages inside Unity along with their dependencies. To test **NugetForUnity**, I created this rather sample Unity project which uses an ML model to run inference using the OnnxRuntime library.

## Project Environment
The project environment consists of a simple `scene` in which we create an empty `model` object and attach a `script`file to it. The `script` consists of a bunch of code that loads the ML model and input images, performs inference, and returns the output predictions.

## Installation
To install the `NugetForUnity` package, head over to [link](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity/releases) and download the `NuGetForUnity.3.0.2.unitypackage` file (or any other version if you want). After downloading the package file, return to your Unity project, go to **Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package** and load the downlaoded `NuGetForUnity.3.0.2.unitypackage` file.
