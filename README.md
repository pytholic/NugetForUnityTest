# NugetForUnity
[NugetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)  is a package management system that makes it easier to install required third-party packages inside Unity along with their dependencies. To test `NugetForUnity`, I created this rather sample Unity project which uses an ML model to run inference using the OnnxRuntime library.
