# NugetForUnity
[NugetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)  is a package management system that makes it easier to install required third-party packages inside Unity along with their dependencies. To test **NugetForUnity**, I created this rather sample Unity project which uses an ML model to run inference using the OnnxRuntime library.

## Project Environment
The project environment consists of a simple `scene` in which we create an empty `model` object and attach a `script`file to it. The `script` consists of a bunch of code that loads the ML model and input images, performs inference, and returns the output predictions.

## Installation
To install the `NugetForUnity` package, head over to [link](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity/releases) and download the `NuGetForUnity.3.0.2.unitypackage` file (or any other version if you want). After downloading the package file, return to your Unity project, go to **Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package** and load the downlaoded `NuGetForUnity.3.0.2.unitypackage` file.

After you finish the installation, there should be a `NuGet` option in the top menu. If you don't see any option, restart your Unity project.

## Installing Packages
To install the required packages using NuGet package manager, click on `NuGet` from the top menu and then select `Manage Nuget Packages`. Now you can see and browse through all the available packages. To install a package, type the name of the required package in the search bar. For this project, I installed the following packages.

* Microsoft.Onnx.Runtime
* Microsoft.Onnx.Runtime.Managed
* SixLabors.ImageSharp

Note that you also need to install **Microsoft.Onnx.Runtime.Managed** along with **Microsoft.Onnx.Runtime** package. `NugetForUnity` will automatically install the required dependencies as well for these packages. It will create a separate `Packages` folder inside your `Assets` folder, that will contain all the packages inatalled via `NugetForUnity` manager.


## Additional Setup
Now for the case of most of the libraries, you just need to install through NuGet manager, and then the libraries will start working directly. However, I found that in the case of native shared libraries i.e. **Microsoft.Onnx.Runtime** in my case, we have to do some additional steps.

1) After you have installed the **Microsoft.Onnx.Runtime** package, head over to **Assets -> Packages -> Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.1.9.0** folder on your local explorer. Note that your folder name can be different depending on the version you are using. Locate `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.1.9.0.nupkg` inside the folder.
2) This step will be different depending on your OS.
  * If you are using **Windows**, rename the `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.1.9.0.nupkg` file to `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.1.9.0.zip` and extract it. Go to **runtimes -> win-x64 -> native** and copy all the `.dll` files (*onnxruntime.dll* and *onnxruntime_providers_shared.dll*). Note that you have to choose the right OS depending on your system. I am using win-x64 based system so I chose that.
  * If you are using **linux-based** system (Ubuntu in my case), extract the `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.1.9.0.nupkg` file. Go to **runtimes -> linux-x64 -> native** and copy the `.so` file (*libonnxruntime.so*)
3) Now create a new folder named `Plugins` inside your `Assets` and paste those files inside it.

That is it. now you should be able to use the packages.

## Cleanup
After copying the `.dll` and `.so` files, you can delete the rest of the extracted files and folder, since you don't need them. Also, you can go to your Unity project, open NuGet Package Manager, and uninstall **Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime** from it if you want. Don't worry, it is not going to affect your project.

## Final Comments
`NugetForUnity` is pretty handy since it is very easy to install the packages with it and it also takes care of the required dependencies. However, the support is limited for native libraries at the moment since we have to perform some manual steps. Still, it can install the required dependencies even for the native libraries which is useful. Hopefully, in the future, we will have more packages a\valable along with more support for native libraries.
